In system design interviews, some protocols are considered more fundamental because they’re commonly used in building scalable, secure, and reliable systems. Here are the most essential protocols and why they're important:

### 1. **HTTP/HTTPS**
   - **Importance**: Nearly all web-based applications rely on HTTP/HTTPS. HTTPS is crucial for securing data in transit.
   - **Interview Relevance**: You should be comfortable discussing how HTTP/HTTPS is used for communication between clients and servers, especially in RESTful APIs and modern web applications. HTTPS is vital for data encryption in applications involving sensitive information.

### 2. **TCP and UDP**
   - **Importance**: TCP and UDP are foundational for understanding reliable (TCP) and fast (UDP) data transfer protocols.
   - **Interview Relevance**: Know when to use TCP (reliable, ordered data) versus UDP (low-latency, connectionless). You’ll often need to explain how TCP is used for critical transactions, while UDP is suitable for video streaming and real-time applications where speed is more important than reliability.

### 3. **WebSocket**
   - **Importance**: Enables real-time, bi-directional communication between client and server over a single connection.
   - **Interview Relevance**: Useful for chat apps, live feeds, and collaborative tools. Understanding WebSocket’s advantages over HTTP polling is helpful when explaining system efficiency and real-time capabilities.

### 4. **gRPC**
   - **Importance**: gRPC is becoming popular in microservices architectures for its efficiency, low latency, and strong support for multiple languages.
   - **Interview Relevance**: Discussing gRPC is valuable when designing efficient, scalable microservices. It’s often used for internal communications due to its speed and smaller payloads, thanks to Protocol Buffers (protobufs).

### 5. **DNS**
   - **Importance**: Translates domain names into IP addresses and is essential for load balancing and routing requests across distributed systems.
   - **Interview Relevance**: Essential in discussions around load balancing, scalability, and fault tolerance. DNS is critical in directing traffic to the right servers and distributing load.

### 6. **TLS/SSL**
   - **Importance**: TLS/SSL secures data transfer, especially in applications where privacy and data integrity are priorities.
   - **Interview Relevance**: Explaining TLS/SSL is vital for any system handling sensitive data, such as payment systems or user authentication. You may also need to discuss how SSL certificates are managed.

### 7. **AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)**
   - **Importance**: AMQP is a reliable protocol for messaging systems, often used with message brokers like RabbitMQ.
   - **Interview Relevance**: Important when discussing event-driven or distributed architectures. AMQP ensures reliable message delivery, and understanding its use in decoupling services is key in scalable designs.

### 8. **SSH (Secure Shell Protocol)**

- **Use**: SSH is a protocol for securely logging into remote servers and transferring files.
- **Example in System Design**: Used in infrastructure management, SSH allows engineers to securely manage servers and perform deployment operations.

### 9. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**

- **Use**: SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services, often over HTTP or SMTP, using XML as the message format.
- **Example in System Design**: SOAP is used in legacy systems and in environments where strict standards are essential, like in financial or governmental applications.

### 10. **SMTP/IMAP/POP3 (Email Protocols)**

- **Use**: These protocols are for sending and receiving email. SMTP is for sending, while IMAP and POP3 are for retrieving.
- **Example in System Design**: In systems with email notifications, like a user registration system, SMTP is commonly integrated to send verification or notification emails.

### 11. **FTP/SFTP (File Transfer Protocol / Secure FTP)**

- **Use**: FTP is used for transferring files between clients and servers, with SFTP providing secure file transfer over SSH.
- **Example in System Design**: FTP/SFTP is used in systems like cloud storage solutions where secure and efficient file transfer is required.

### Honorable Mentions

- **MQTT**: Useful in IoT scenarios but less critical unless IoT is central to the design.
- **SMTP**: Important for email notifications but not always essential in a system design interview unless specific requirements involve email.

### Summary of Priorities for Interviews

If you’re short on time, focus on **HTTP/HTTPS**, **TCP/UDP**, **WebSocket**, **gRPC**, **DNS**, and **TLS/SSL**. These protocols cover the most common use cases and requirements, such as web communication, data security, real-time updates, and efficient inter-service communication in modern, scalable systems.
